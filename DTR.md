Project: Brownfield of Dreams

Group Member Names: Glynnis O’Connell & Nathan Thomas

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): Nathan - would like to have more repitition with API consumption, solidifying Active Record methods. Glynnis - tackle API consumption and understanding OAuth

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here): Strong collaboration styles, strong personality similarities, we both will try pretty much anything to make something work/tests pass, Glynnis’ enthusiasm/cheerleaderness will help when we come across tough problems and are beating our heads against the wall. We’ll be assisting each other in timeboxing struggles, as well as ensuring that we stay on course to update the code. We’re both very strong with communication, transparent with if we’re stuck or not, etc. 

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: ENTHUSIASM and we’re too legit to quit

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?): Nathan - gets in early, and stays late, would prefer pairing vs. individual. Glynnis - usually tries to arrive by 8:15/8:30, leaves campus by 6pm generally, happy to stay longer if productive work is happening, and also would prefer to pair vs. working individually. We plan on utilizing project work time by pairing, and realize that both of us need some time to ourselves for life.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): ALL THE TIME. We’re both very communicative, and transparent.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): Being able to vocalize issues we’re running into, asking the proper debugging questions, talk about our code better/more technically

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): We’re planning to pair for a lot of this, so hopefully we both get great exposure to the learning goals. 

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): We’ll be reviewing each others’ pull requests, notifying each other of them when we’re not together to be looked over, and transparent with one another when we’re stuck on something.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: Both of us would prefer feedback (any kind) over not receiving any at all, but keep emotions in mind when deciding the appropriate time to give feedback.

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools): GH Projects
